This project implements a fully-functional Deep Neural Network (DNN) from scratch using only NumPy, designed to mimic the modular and layered architecture style of popular deep-learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.

The goal of the project is to provide a clear, educational, and extensible implementation that reveals how modern neural-network libraries work internally—while still offering a clean, high-level API for building models.
